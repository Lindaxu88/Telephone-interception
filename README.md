# Telephone-interception
These codes are the Python code implementation of a machine learning phone interception project
## The Task
A mobile system based on Android that directly intercepts most users who hang up and classify them as harassing phone numbers. With the development of recommendation functions and the complexity of different types of marketing calls in real-world environments, we hope to update this feature. We decided to use the collected data of 10000 phone numbers containing multiple information for classification, and use machine learning models to divide the phone into harassing calls and partially effective marketing calls, distinguishing and intercepting harassing calls and some potentially useful marketing calls.
